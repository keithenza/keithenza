<h2>Hi there! Welcome to my Github. <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514936/9579/blob_excited.gif?1643514936" width="30"/> </h2>

<p>It's great to meet you! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514069/259/handshake.png?1643514069" width="20"/> I'm Keith, and I am currently a student in the Master's in Statistics & Data Science program at KU Leuven. 
</br> With prior experience working as an analytics consultant for emerging companies and as a strategic operator in big tech, I am driven to use my skills in data science, analytics, and AI to help improve and solve challenges in modern business environments. </p>

<h3>Some projects I've worked on:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/keithenza/WWI-Poster-Analysis-Datathon">Simulating AI Agents Response to WWII Propaganda Using TinyTroupe</a> (Best Pitch Prize at Datathon 2025)
    <br/>
    We used TinyTroupe to simulate the reaction of AI agents (that were tasked to assume the personality of a Belgian citizen during WWII) to real German-made propaganda. This is a proof-of-concept project to check on the applications of AI towards (dis)information in current media. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/keithenza/Horizon-Europe-MDA">Analyzing Horizon Europe Projects with RAG Implementation</a>
    <br/>
    We made a website that analyzes the impact and scale of projects in Horizon Europe. We also made a RAG (locally-hosted only, unfortunately) to allow users understand the projects more easily in the billion-euro initiative.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/keithenza/Advanced-Analytics-Assignments/tree/main/Assignment%201">Using AutoML for Real Estate Price Predictions</a>
    <br/>
    We used AutoML to predict real estate prices in Belgium that were scraped from online listing websites using information such as area, location, postal code, number of bedrooms, etc. in a tabular format. We earned second-place from the whole class, with the main drivers being efficient data cleaning and acute data transformations + augmentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/keithenza/Advanced-Analytics-Assignments/tree/main/Assignment%202/notebooks">Classifying Countries of Google Street Map Images using Transfer Learning with Keras</a>
    <br/>
    We used Keras for a transfer learning machine learning exercise using EfficientNetB6 to classify scraped Google Street Map images into their respective countries (akin to GeoGuesser), achieving a roughly 78% accuracy across 12 countries.
  </li>
    <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/keithenza/credit-default-risk-modeling">Credit Default Risk Modeling from Augemented Data from Public Sources</a>
    <br/>
    We used data from Orbis to predict the credit risk default probability of public & private companies in the European Union using XGBoost and made a dashboard using Plotly Dash, as part of our statistical consulting project.
  </li>
</ul>
